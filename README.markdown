# CK Landing

An immersive, fully responsive landing page. This project was intended to demonstrate my ability to solve a UI challenge, with special emphasis on my problem solving process, UI & UX abilities, as well as quality of code implementation.

[The production URL can be found here.](http://ck-landing.herokuapp.com/)

This app was built using Rails, with some JavaScript sprinkled in, and features:
 - Rich design process documentation
 - API integration with Instagram
 - Hand coded, fully responsive layout.

## Process Documentation

 1. `git clone git@github.com:adamcaron/ck_landing_page.git`
