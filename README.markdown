# CK Landing

A immersive, fully responsive landing page.

This project was intended to demonstrate my ability to solve a UI challenge, with special emphasis on my problem solving process, UI & UX abilities, as well as quality of code implementation.

[The production URL can be found here.](http://ck-landing.herokuapp.com/)

This app was built using Rails, with some JavaScript sprinkled in.

Features:
 - Rich design process documentation
 - API integration with Instagram
 - Hand coded, fully responsive layout.

 **This project can also be run locally:**

`git clone git@github.com:adamcaron/ck_landing_page.git`
`rake db:create`
`rails s`
navigate to localhost:3000

## Process Documentation

My thought process was [fully documented here](http://ck-landing.herokuapp.com/process).
